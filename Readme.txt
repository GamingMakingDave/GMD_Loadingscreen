Thanks for buying the loading screen, I am confident that you can learn a lot from it and understand some of the ways. 

You can find the wiki here: https://gmd-scripts.gitbook.io/gmd/

If you have any problems you can also contact me in the Discord here: https://discord.gg/VVY6wrbCmR or 
in the CFX forum here: https://forum.cfx.re/t/esx-free-gmd-loadingscreen-completely-adjustable-via-js-mp4-mp3-and-picture-support/4936170


Own logos as well as MP4 Loadingmovies can be ordered with me these I Design you in such a way as you want to have them.

So have fun with the loadingscreen.
